[> Intro
---------
LiteX is an alternative to MiSoC maintained and used by Enjoy-Digital to build 
our cores, integrate them in complete SoC and load/flash them to the hardware.

The structure of LiteX is kept close to MiSoC to ease collaboration between 
projects.

LiteX is based on Migen.

[> License
-----------
LiteX is copyright (c) 2015 Enjoy-Digital under BSD Lisense.
Since it is based on MiSoC, please also refer to LICENSE file in soc directory
or git history to get correct copyrights.

[> Sub-packages
----------------
gen:
  Provides specific or experimentatl modules to generate HDL that are not integrated
  in Migen.

build:
  Provides tools to build FPGA bitstreams (interface to vendor toolchains) and to
  simulate HDL code or full SoCs.

soc:
  Provides definitions/modules to build cores (bus, bank, flow), cores and tools
  to build a SoC from such cores.

boards:
  Provides platforms and targets for the supported boards.

[> Quick start guide
--------------------
0. If cloned from Git without the --recursive option, get the submodules:
  git submodule update --init

1. Install Python 3.3+ and FPGA vendor's development tools and JTAG tools.

2. Compile and install binutils. Take the latest version from GNU.
  mkdir build && cd build
  ../configure --target=lm32-elf
  make
  make install

3. (Optional, only if you want to use a lm32 CPU in you SoC)
  Compile and install GCC. Take gcc-core and gcc-g++ from GNU
  (version 4.5 or >=4.9).
  rm -rf libstdc++-v3
  mkdir build && cd build
  ../configure --target=lm32-elf --enable-languages="c,c++" --disable-libgcc \
    --disable-libssp
  make
  make install

4. Build the target of your board...:
  Go to boards/targets and execute the target you want to build

5. ... and/or install Verilator and test LiteX on your computer:
  Download and install Verilator: http://www.veripool.org/
  Go to boards/targets
  ./sim.py

6. Run a terminal program on the board's serial port at 115200 8-N-1.
  You should get the BIOS prompt.
