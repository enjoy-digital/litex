a high performance and small footprint SoC based on Migen


[> Features
-----------
 * LatticeMico32 CPU, modified to include an optional MMU (experimental).
 * mor1kx (a better OpenRISC implementation) as alternative CPU option.
 * High performance memory controller capable of issuing several SDRAM commands
   per FPGA cycle.
 * Supports SDR, DDR, LPDDR, DDR2 and DDR3.
 * Provided peripherals: UART, GPIO, timer, GPIO, NOR flash controller, SPI
   flash controller, Ethernet MAC, and more.
 * High performance:
   - on Spartan-6, 83MHz system clock frequencies, 10+Gbps DDR
   SDRAM bandwidth, 1080p 32bpp framebuffer, etc.
   - on Kintex-7, 125MHz system clock frequencies (up to 200MHz without DDR3),
   64Gbps DDR3 SDRAM bandwidth.
 * Low resource usage: basic implementation fits easily in Spartan-6 LX9.
 * Portable and easy to customize thanks to Python- and Migen-based
   architecture.
 * Design new peripherals using Migen and benefit from automatic CSR maps
   and logic, etc.
 * Possibility to encapsulate legacy Verilog/VHDL code.

MiSoC comes with built-in support for the following boards:
 * Mixxeo, the digital video mixer from M-Labs [XC6SLX45]
 * Milkymist One, the original M-Labs video synthesizer [XC6SLX45]
 * Papilio Pro, a simple and low-cost development board [XC6SLX9]
 * KC705, a Kintex-7 devboard from Xilinx [XC7K325T]
MiSoC is portable and support for other boards can easily be added as external
modules.

[> Quick start guide
--------------------
1. Install Python 3.3+, Migen and FPGA vendor's development tools.
  Get Migen from: https://github.com/m-labs/migen

2. Install JTAG tools.
  For Mixxeo and M1:          http://urjtag.org
  For Papilio Pro and KC705:  http://xc3sprog.sourceforge.net

3. Obtain and build any required flash proxy bitstreams. Flash proxy bitstreams
  give JTAG access to a flash chip through the FPGA.
  For Mixxeo and M1: https://github.com/m-labs/fjmem-m1
  For Papilio Pro:   https://github.com/GadgetFactory/Papilio-Loader
    (xc3sprog/trunk/bscan_spi/bscan_spi_lx9_papilio.bit)
  For KC705: https://github.com/m-labs/bscan_spi_kc705

4. Compile and install binutils. Take the latest version from GNU.
  mkdir build && cd build
  ../configure --target=lm32-elf
  make
  make install

5. Compile and install GCC. Take gcc-core and gcc-g++ from GNU (version 4.5 or >=4.9).
  rm -rf libstdc++-v3
  mkdir build && cd build
  ../configure --target=lm32-elf --enable-languages="c,c++" --disable-libgcc --disable-libssp
  make
  make install

6. Build and flash the BIOS and bitstream. Run from MiSoC:
  For Mixxeo:      ./make.py all
  For M1:          ./make.py -p m1 all
  For Papilio Pro: ./make.py -t ppro all
  For KC705:       ./make.py -t kc705 all

7. Run a terminal program on the board's serial port at 115200 8-N-1.
  You should get the BIOS prompt.

8. Read and experiment with the source!
