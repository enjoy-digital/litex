[> Intro
--------
LiteX is a MiSoC-based SoC builder using Migen as Python DSL that can be used
to create SoCs and full FPGA designs.

LiteX provides specific building/debugging tools for high level of abstraction
and compatibily with the LiteX core ecosystem.

Think of Migen as a toolbox to create FPGA designs in Python and LiteX as a
toolbox to create/develop/debug FPGA SoCs in Python.


Typical LiteX design flow:

LiteX already supports various softcores CPUs: LM32, Mor1kx, PicoRV32, VexRiscv
and is compatible with the LiteX's Cores Ecosystem:

[> Sub-packages
---------------
gen:
  Provides specific or experimental modules to generate HDL that are not integrated
  in Migen.

build:
  Provides tools to build FPGA bitstreams (interface to vendor toolchains) and to
  simulate HDL code or full SoCs.

soc:
  Provides definitions/modules to build cores (bus, bank, flow), cores and tools
  to build a SoC from such cores.

boards:
  Provides platforms and targets for the supported boards. All Migen's platforms
  can also be used in LiteX.

[> Very Quick start guide (for newcomers)
-----------------------------------------
TimVideos.us has done an awesome job for setting up a LiteX environment easily in
the litex-buildenv repo: https://github.com/timvideos/litex-buildenv

It's recommended for newcomers to go this way. Various FPGA boards are supported
and multiple examples provided! You can even run Linux on your FPGA using LiteX
very easily!

Migen documentation can be found here: https://m-labs.hk/migen/manual

FPGA lessons/tutorials can be found at: https://github.com/enjoy-digital/fpga_101


[> Quick start guide (for advanced users)
-----------------------------------------
0. Install Python 3.5+ and FPGA vendor's development tools.

1. Install Migen/LiteX and the LiteX's cores:
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enjoy-digital/litex/master/litex_setup.py
  ./litex_setup.py init install
  Later, if you need to update all repositories:
  ./litex_setup.py update

2. Install a RISC-V toolchain:
  wget https://static.dev.sifive.com/dev-tools/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.1.0-2019.01.0-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14.tar.gz
  tar -xvf riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.1.0-2019.01.0-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14.tar.gz
  export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.1.0-2019.01.0-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14/bin/

3. Build the target of your board...:
  Go to boards/targets and execute the target you want to build

4. ... and/or install Verilator and test LiteX on your computer:
  Download and install Verilator: http://www.veripool.org/
  On Fedora:
      sudo dnf install libevent-devel json-c-devel
  On Ubuntu:
      sudo apt install libevent-dev libjson-c-dev
  run: litex_sim

5. Run a terminal program on the board's serial port at 115200 8-N-1.
  You should get the BIOS prompt.
