# Wishbone USB Protocol Bridge
# ============================
#
# This module implements a bridge to connect LiteX to the target system's
# Wishbone bus via USB.  It uses `vendor` packets to communicate, which are
# normally reserved.  Since we're the vendors of this USB protocol, we take
# advantage of this packet type to implement the bridge.
#
# All traffic goes to/from USB EP0, which is guaranteed to exist regardless
# of the user's device implementation.  The 8th bit of the first SETUP DATA
# transaction contains all the information we need to mark this as a
# Wishbone packet.
#
# Packets going to EP0 always start with a SETUP packet, followed by an IN
# or an OUT packet, followed by an OUT or an IN packet.
#
# The SETUP packet looks like this:
#
# +----+----+----------+----+----+
# | C3 | 00 | ADDRESS  | 04 | 00 |   read packet
# +----+----+----------+----+----+
#   1    1        4      1    1
#
# +----+----+----------+----+----+
# | 43 | 00 | ADDRESS  | 04 | 00 |   write packet
# +----+----+----------+----+----+
#   1    1        4      1    1
#
# If the transaction is a "read" transaction, the device responds with an OUT
# packet with the data.  If the transaction is a "write" transaction, the host
# responds with an IN packet with the data.
#
# Much like other Wishbone bridges, there are two types of packets.  The first
# byte indicates what type of packet it is, and that it is a Wishbone Bridge
# packet.  This is the value "0x40" (VENDOR type packet destined for DEVICE)
# with the "Data Phase Transfer" bit either set or cleared:
#     - Read:  0xc3
#     - Write: 0x43
#
# The next byte is bRequest, which in the current implementation is unused.
# Set this value to 0.
#
# The next four bytes form the wValue and wIndex values of the SETUP token.
# We reuse these two 16-bit values as a single 32-bit ADDRESS packet.  Note that
# USB is big endian.
#
# Finally, the last two bytes indicate the length of the transaction.  Since
# we only support 32-bit reads and writes, this is always 4.  On big endian
# USB, this has the value {04, 00}.
