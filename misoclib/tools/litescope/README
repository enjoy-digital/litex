       A small footprint and configurable embedded FPGA
             logic analyzer core powered by Migen

[> Intro
---------
LiteScope is a small footprint and configurable embedded logic analyzer that you
can use in your FPGA and aims to provide a free, portable and flexible
alternative to vendor's solutions!

LiteScope is part of MiSoC libraries whose aims are to lower entry level of complex
FPGA cores by providing simple, elegant and efficient implementations of
components used in today's SoC such as Ethernet, SATA, PCIe, SDRAM Controller...

The core uses simple and specific streaming buses and will provides in the future
adapters to use standardized AXI or Avalon-ST streaming buses.

Since Python is used to describe the HDL, the core is highly and easily
configurable.

LiteScope uses technologies developed in partnership with M-Labs Ltd:
 - Migen enables generating HDL with Python in an efficient way.
 - MiSoC provides the basic blocks to build a powerful and small footprint SoC.

LiteScope can be used as a Migen/MiSoC library (by simply installing  it
with the provided setup.py) or can be integrated with your standard design flow
by generating the verilog rtl that you will use as a standard core.

LiteScope handles various export formats: .vcd, .sr(sigrok), .csv, .py...

Since LiteScope also provides a UART <--> Wishbone brige so you only need 2
external Rx/Tx pins to be ready to debug or control all your Wishbone peripherals!

[> Features
-----------
- IO peek and poke with LiteScopeIO
- Logic analyser with LiteScopeLA:
  - Various triggering modules: Term, Range, Edge (add yours! :)
  - Run Length Encoder to "compress" data and increase recording depth
  - Subsampling
  - Storage qualifier
  - Data storage in block rams
- Bridges:
  - UART2Wishbone (provided by LiteScope)
  - Ethernet2Wishbone ("Etherbone") (when used with LiteEth)

[> Possible improvements
-------------------------
- add standardized interfaces (AXI, Avalon-ST)
- add protocols analyzers
- add signals injection/generation
- add storage in DRAM
- add storage in HDD with LiteSATA core (to be released soon!)
- add PCIe Wishbone bridge with LitePCIe (to be released soon!)
- ... See below Support and consulting :)

If you want to support these features, please contact us at florent [AT]
enjoy-digital.fr. You can also contact our partner on the public mailing list
devel [AT] lists.m-labs.hk.


[> Getting started
------------------
1. Install Python3 and your vendor's software

2. Obtain Migen and install it:
  git clone https://github.com/m-labs/migen
  cd migen
  python3 setup.py install
  cd ..

3. Obtain MiSoC:
  git clone https://github.com/m-labs/misoc --recursive

4. Build and load test design:
  go to misoclib/tools/litescope/example_designs/
  ./make.py -p [your_platform] all load-bitstream
  Supported platforms are the ones already supported by Mibuild:
  de0nano, m1, mixxeo, kc705, zedboard...

5. Test design:
  go to [..]/example_designs/test/ and run:
  ./make.py --port your_serial_port io (will blink leds)
  ./make.py --port your_serial_port la (will capture counter)

  tests can also be executed over Etherbone (provided with LiteEth):
  ./make.py --ip_address fpga_ip_address io
  ./make.py --ip_address fpga_ip_address la

[> License
-----------
LiteScope is released under the very permissive two-clause BSD license. Under the
terms of this license, you are authorized to use LiteScope for closed-source
proprietary designs.
Even though we do not require you to do so, those things are awesome, so please
do them if possible:
 - tell us that you are using LiteScope
 - cite LiteScope in publications related to research it has helped
 - send us feedback and suggestions for improvements
 - send us bug reports when something goes wrong
 - send us the modifications and improvements you have done to LiteScope.

[> Support and consulting
--------------------------
We love open-source hardware and like sharing our designs with others.

LiteScope is mainly developed and maintained by EnjoyDigital.

If you would like to know more about LiteScope or if you are already a happy user
and would like to extend it for your needs, EnjoyDigital can provide standard
commercial support as well as consulting services.

So feel free to contact us, we'd love to work with you! (and eventually shorten
the list of the possible improvements :)
